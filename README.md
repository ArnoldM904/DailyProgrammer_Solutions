<h3>Problem Descriptions: </h3>


<strong> [Easy] Challange #1 -- Completed (Extra credit criteria met) </strong>

Create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. 
Have it tell them the information back, in the format:
"Your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)."
For extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.
